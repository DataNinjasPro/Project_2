# Intro to Console/Bash

## From the Terminal/Console and using only the command line, create the following

* A new folder with the name of project_stuff

* A new VBA file with the name of project.vbs

* Open the current folder containing the new VBA file.

## BONUS

* Create multiple directories/folders with the names `one_folder` and `second_folder` in one command.

* Create multiple files with the names `one.vbs` and `two.vbs` in one command in the project_stuff directory.
